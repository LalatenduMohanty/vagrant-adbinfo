# Contributing to ADB

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to the vagrant-adbinfo plugin, which is hosted in the `Project Atomic Organization <https://github.com/projectatomic>`_ on GitHub.

These are just guidelines, please use your best judgment and feel free to
propose changes to this document in a pull request.

At this point, this document is not complete, but as decisions are made on `container-tools@redhat.com <https://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/container-tools>`_ ML they will be added to this document. 

## Pull Requests

* All changes will be made by pull request (PR), even from core committers/maintainers. 
* All changes need 2 ACKs from maintainers before they will be merged. If the author of the PR is a maintainer, their submission is considered to be the first ACK.  Therefore PRs from maintainers only need one additional ACK.
  By "2 ACKs" we mean that 2 maintainers must acknowledge that the change is a good one. The 2nd person to ACK the PR should merge the PR with a comment including their agreement.
