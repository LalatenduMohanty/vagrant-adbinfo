Display docker information from a vagrant machine, similar to what boot2docker provides

Based in part on the work done by Michael Kuzmin for vagrant-guestip at https://github.com/mkuzmin/vagrant-guestip

Dev Notes:

1 - Install VirtualBox (http://www.if-not-true-then-false.com/2010/install-virtualbox-with-yum-on-fedora-centos-red-hat-rhel/)

2 - Get a box to test

3 - Build a vagrant file

4 - bundle install

5 - bundle exec vagrant up # starts the vagrant box

6 - bundle exec vagrant adbinfo # tests the command
